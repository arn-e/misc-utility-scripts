## Utility Scripts

This is a collection of utility scripts I've written at one point or another.  
Some of them are deprecated, some were written with a *very* specific scope in mind.

Please feel free to use them, however I do ask two things :

  * Use at your own risk (of course)
  * Don't judge the code **too** harshly :)

Any questions, please feel free to reach out.
